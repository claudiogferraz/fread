## About

Fread is an Open Source GTK app that can assist you at improving your reading 
speed by letting you gradually lower the interval in which the words from a 
chosen text will appear on the screen.  

Doing that for around an hour every day helped me "learn" speed reading and 
while I can't absolutely guarantee it'll work for you (had to include this part 
for legal reasons lol), I definitely think you should give this a try.  

In my experience it also translated pretty well to paper reading as I (at some 
point) stopped mentally "voicing" it.

**THIS IS STILL IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT**
